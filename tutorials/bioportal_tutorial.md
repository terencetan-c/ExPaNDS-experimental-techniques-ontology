### Tutorial for using PaNET in BioPortal

Navigate to the PaNET ontology in BioPortal. The summary page gives an overview of the ontology. In the 'Submissions' section, the different versions of the PaNET ontology can be downloaded in various file formats, such as OWL, for more advanced exploration and usage of the ontology. You can navigate the different tabs on the top, but usually, only 'Summary', 'Classes', and 'Properties' are of interest.

The 'Classes' tab allows you to explore the hierarchy of PaNET.

On the left is the list of techniques. The icons to the left of each technique class in the list are expand/collapse view controls. The plus sign (+) indicates that the technique class has nested (child) classes or subclasses that are currently collapsed. Clicking the plus sign will expand the class to reveal its contents. The minus sign indicates that the class has nested (child) classes that are currently expanded. Clicking the minus sign will collapse the item, hiding the subclasses.

Alternatively, you can search for specific technique classes in the search bar.

Upon selecting or clicking on a technique class, the right side of the 'Classes' tab provides more information (within the 'Details', 'Visualization', 'Notes', and 'Mappings' tabs) regarding the technique selected, including a unique and persistent identifier 'Id', human-readable labels, subclass relationships, and any mappings to terms in other vocabularies/ontologies.

The 'Properties' tab shows the properties used in PaNET. The right side displays the ID for each property, which also reveals the vocabulary from which the property is imported. For example, 'affliation' is imported from schema.org, revealed by its ID: http://schema.org/affiliation. Clicking on these IDs/links would also redirect to webpages that can provide further information about the respective properties.
